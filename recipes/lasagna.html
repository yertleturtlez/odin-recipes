    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1 (10-ounce) package baby spinach</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup refrigerated basil pesto</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 (24-ounce) jar low-sodium marinara sauce, divided</li>
        <li>12 no-boil whole-wheat lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly coat a 9-by-13-inch broiler-safe baking 
            dish with cooking spray. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over 
            medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring 
            occasionally, until the mushroom liquid has cooked off and the vegetables 
            are tender, about 8 minutes.  Add sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon 
            salt and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 
            1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. (Do not wipe the skillet clean.)</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan; heat over medium-high heat. Add 
            spinach; cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Transfer 
            to a clean kitchen towel and let cool for 5 minutes. Gather the towel and 
            squeeze firmly over the sink to remove as much liquid as possible. Transfer 
            the spinach to a cutting board and roughly chop. Add to the vegetable mixture; 
            stir until combined.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup mozzarella, ricotta, 1/2 cup Parmesan, pesto, egg and the 
            remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl; stir until well blended.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup marinara in the prepared baking dish; top with a layer of 4 
            noodles. Spread 1 cup ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles; top with 2 
            cups vegetable mixture. Repeat the layers once. Top with the remaining 4 
            noodles, 1 cup ricotta mixture and 1 cup marinara. Sprinkle with the remaining 
            1½ cups mozzarella and ½ cup Parmesan. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes. Carefully remove the foil;  bake until the top is 
            browned around the edges, about 20 minutes more. Let cool slightly, about 
            10 minutes. Slice and serve topped with basil.</li>
    </ol>
