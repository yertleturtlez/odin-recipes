            garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the meat

        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to 
            combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of 
            the liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little saucy.

        <li>Warm the taco shells according to their package directions.</li>
        <li>Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. Top with

            tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.</li>
