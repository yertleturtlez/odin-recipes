    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A wonderful and easy to make pizza. Great for a nice dinner, or maybe a cheeky brunch!</p>
    <p>Just heat up a oven, pop it in, and enjoy this cheesy covered dough. Yummy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball pizza dough</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>Semolina flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>¼ cup Basic Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or oregano leaves, for garnishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let chilled covered dough stand at room temperature until dough is cool 
            (not cold) and a fingerprint remains when dough is pressed, 1 to 2 hours. 
            Transfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured surface. Using floured 
            fingertips, firmly press all over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border.</li>
        <li>If cooking in your home oven, preheat to 500°F with a baking steel or 
            large round cast-iron pizza pan (such as Lodge 15-inch) on middle rack. 
            Let pan preheat in oven for about 30 minutes. If using an outdoor pizza 
            oven, preheat pizza oven and pizza stone according to manufacturer's 
            instructions on high 20 minutes. (Note: Cooking with wood takes more 
            experience to control the heat, so we've only included instructions for 
            gas oven cooking here.)</li>
        <li>Form a C-shape with the outer edge of your hand, and press firmly inside 
            dough border to define a 1/2-inch wide ring around edge of dough. Lift dough 
            onto the knuckles of both hands, and gently stretch, rotating dough after 
            each stretch to maintain its round shape. Continue gently stretching dough, 
            allowing gravity to help it expand, until a 10-inch circle of even thickness 
            forms, with a slightly thicker outer ring. Lay dough round on a semolina-dusted 
            pizza peel, reshaping as needed to form a circle. Spread dough round with Basic 
            Pizza Sauce. Top with shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Gently shake pizza peel with prepared pie to loosen. If pizza feels stuck in 
            any areas, carefully lift pizza edge with a bench scraper, and dust peel with 
            a 1:1 mixture of semolina and bread flour. Unload pizza onto preheated pan in 
            home oven, or onto stone in outdoor pizza oven using quick, decisive movements: 
            Set the peel edge on the pan at about a 20-degree angle, and quickly pull back 
            peel to slide half of the pizza onto the pan. Gently shake the peel side to 
            side while pulling it back to slide the rest of the pizza onto the pan, 
            allowing it to stretch slightly.</li>
        <li>If baking in a home oven, bake at 500°F until edges of crust have puffed 
            slightly, about 3 minutes. Rotate pan 90 degrees, and increase oven temperature 
            to broil. Broil until pizza is cooked through and crust is browned, 3 to 6 
            minutes. If baking in an outdoor pizza oven, cook pizza, using peel to rotate 
            pizza 90 degrees every 20 to 30 seconds, until cooked through and crust is risen 
            and charred in spots, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using peel, transfer pizza to a cutting board. Garnish with fresh basil or oregano, 
            if desired, and cut into wedges.</li>
    </ol>
